"5S886P0775","A bit on the longer side. Delved quite deeply into the content not on the slides, losing the audience a bit. Otherwise great presentation and audience engagement.|So interesting! I am not a research girly but I loved this!|I'm biased but Abigail deserves an 8!"

"323504S9S0","Sounds like an interesting, yet challenging internship!|Good luck Aramis!|Spoke very softly, I would recommend speaking louder.

"
"6P54355364","great job. I actually worked in the rehab center my first semester|Make the font bigger it's kind of hard to read from certain points in the room.|She was clear and concise when speaking, her voice was not that loud but she genuinely did a great job. I was completely unaware this could even be an internship, she made me aware of pathways I did not know existed.|Quite a bit of info on each slide with little visuals but great job overall!!|Hard to read the wording on the presentation since a lot of the slides had a lot of words.|Good presentation, very detailed! Some text was kind of small and harder to read, but overall nice presentation."
"61219200Y6","GIRL YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB|I enjoyed your interactive activities, great job overall! Loved the design and animations. |Good explanation of information! |Great presentation|She was well versed on her topic. her power point itself looked really nice but the method in which she chose to present it was in a video style, it made things difficult to read depending on when she decided to pause the video."
"924Y6142P0","Really good overall|This internship sounds so interesting! I agree that it would have been even more interesting and you could have done more in person, but it still sounds like a great experience!|gooda|I didn't get much time to read any of the slides with the massive amount of words. It distracted me from the speaker, though she had decent presentation skills."
"96SY0P7884","Amazing! |Very good Presentation. Budgeting is a great skill to learn. Great job. this internship definitely requires hard work.|really good presentation!!|Great job!|Good presentation|Please add a work sample that you did to help explain more about your tasks.|Overall, a solid presentation.

"5SY24Y1365","Great job!|Great presentation, so much information about this stuff that a lot of people don't know about.|interesting internship. Very knowledgeable.|So super slay! Great job- it looks like a very interesting place to intern.|By far one of the best presentations that was given. She was loud and clear the entire time. She was extremely educational throughout the duration of her power point. I loved the images she used!|good luck on the SPD test!|Great presentation|Very clear and loud. Good explanations of tasks and procedures. However, the use of the word retarded was inappropriate and uncalled for."
"520751P26S","She seemed super excited and passionate about her experience. Really refreshing to hear someone have a great internship.|She delved perhaps a little too deeply into the background info, making me zone out a little. If it was kept surface level it would be a near perfect presentation|Love the theme! Overall, this internship sounds like it was super fun and interesting :)|Overloaded on information a bit too much
Used ""Latinx"" don't recommend that term. |Really long and a lot of unnecessary information was included. Also slow down the pace|Great presentation. Would just work on your timing because I think you might have gone over. "
"3656P075P2","great job!|Great looking presentation!|You're really good at public speaking, don't be scared to do it!!|Good presentation! Could have spoke slightly louder but overall very good!|Do not say things like ""I, damn"", reduce stuttering by practicing more presenting, work on eye contact, and ask more questions."
"5032575693","Good job!|Great job! Really loved the design!|Overall a very good presentation, well designed and thought out slides. Good work!"

"PY3Y20P902","Try to be more comfortable when presenting, it is your throne!|great job!|Good presentation! Very enthusiastic and entertaining.|You did amazing!|Short and to the point|Was the only presentation that occurred thus far that I was able to follow easily and actually read what she had written down in her power point. I had absolutely no interest in the genuine internship she had completed but she made it captivating enough to pay attention and absorb what she was saying."
"PY231239Y6","Good explanation of your experience! |Great voice and presentation!|great job. Very interesting!"
"Y139S30PSP","Perfect!|Very professional |Presentation was clear. I learned about body doubling and how it can be beneficial. He was very engage and passionate about his work. I love how he is adapting what he learns to his class|great work and good luck with your future promotions! |Great presentation! |Great job overall! Maybe limit the text on screen to make it a little easier to read for audience.|Javier did an amazing job at presenting but I recommend that he asks the audience some questions to help me it more interactive and entertaining.|His presentation was amazing. I am honestly jealous of his public speaking skills. You would think that after being forced to take public speaking by FSC I would be an adequate public speakerâ€¦ that is sadly not the case. 

Some of his text was too small for my pathetic eyes to read, but overall his presentation was amazing.   
|Very well spoken and composed! A wonderful presentation to listen to."
"P10S8P7714","Great presentation, and samples. Would limit the amount of text you have on your slides otherwise great job. |So cool! My brother is an OT it seems so interesting and fun|Too much information on the slides, should be more reliant on your own information. Very poor visual presentation but great speaking skills|Very informative!|Demonstrated good knowledge and detailed tasks well. Only thing is preparedness for the presentation could have been better|I loved how well spoken she was, she knew her goals and what she wanted to do. Her plans and her experience were well communicated.|kayleigh"

Solid presentation skills too. |Love the theme and the pictures at the end! :)|Was a good presentation. You know what you are talking about so be confident about what you are saying. Even though you were nervous you did a nice job!|Great balance of humor and demonstration of knowledge. As someone who worked in ABA as well, I would say she got a little too deep into the nitty gritty and probably lost a lot of the audience|It looked nice and was very informative"
"13P15P5S5P","Covered every aspect of the experience while keeping it understandable. Great audience engagement. Very prepared and knowledgeable.|The theme is so cool! I love the quote at the end :)|Very, very knowledgeable and interesting information. Presentation skills aren't the greatest, could use more eye contact and look at the audience more. A bit too reliant on the slide (which are very tasteful), Very fun presentation! |Very creative presentation. The only thing I would work on his delivery (was a little quiet) "

"0Y7868SP8Y","Knew the information very well and was enthusiastic about his internship|Pedro has a really great presence in front of the room.
