"5","8CEBmYGcvS","I couldn't hear her and she read directly off the slides. She didn't explain the graphics. and didn't seem very prepared. The slides were very wordy. She didn't really explain her major learnings in detail.   | It was really hard to hear and the format was very basic with minimal graphics and pictures, not practiced, and seemed to be put together last minute with lots of words and no contextual information on the slides. She also didn't have 4 major learning experiences, only 3.  | She explained how there was more improvement in responsibility. | Even through there was no possible way of show what the work that she did at the internship. She did a good job explaining on what she did at her internship.   | Good presentation just a lot of text on slides. "
